# SwftlyReachable

A Reachability framework for iOS 8 with background updates.

[SwiftTime](http://swiftti.me) blog post coming soon.

When cloning use: git submodule update --init --recursive to get the Quick/Nimble testing frameworks and Async

Currently SwiftlyReachable is using Swift 1.1 so if you want to run the tests you need to checkout branch `` swift-1.1 `` in both `` Vendor/Quick `` and `` Vendor/Nimble ``.
